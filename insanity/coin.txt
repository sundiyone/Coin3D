Why does cmake quarter install *.so without exe?

cd coin_build
rm -rf *
export PATH=/home/ed/Coin3D/coin_install/bin:$PATH
CPPFLAGS=-I/home/ed/Coin3D/coin_install/include ../coin/configure --prefix=/home/ed/Coin3D/coin_install --enable-3ds-import
make
make install


Factoid: Coin is building libraries *.a with each directory.  Why aren't *those* used for
the final build?  Or am I mixed up?  No, that's the official build.
