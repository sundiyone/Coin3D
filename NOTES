The repository over at /home/ed/Coin3D_temp/coin seems to have another copy of src and everything at the top level.
At the lower, 'correct level' the hg repo seems to be more up to date than emergent and coin4 (which began as a copy of emergent).

Consider:

kdiff3 Coin3D_temp/coin/src/ Coin3D/emergent/coin/src/&

Mostly the diffs are copyright.
There *are* some goodies though.

It might be worth trying to apply the coin4 megapatches to an up-to-date hg branch.

[DONE with a cool script] Or I could mechanically merge the new Copyright into coin4 and see where we go from there.

----------------------------------

I'm going to have to rename the library version:
COIN_MAJOR_VERSION

../coin4/configure.ac:m4_define([SO_NUMBER], [m4_eval(COIN_MAJOR*20)])
../coin4/configure.ac:AC_SUBST([COIN_SO_VERSION], [SO_NUMBER])

../coin4/configure:COIN_SO_VERSION
../coin4/configure:COIN_SO_VERSION=80

COIN_SO_VERSION
----------------------------------
