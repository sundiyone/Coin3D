.RI "class \fBSoCache\fP"
.br
.RI "The \fBSoCache\fP class is the superclass for all internal cache classes\&.
.PP
It organizes reference counting to make it possible to share cache instances\&. It also organizes a list of elements that will affect the cache\&. If any of the elements have changed since the cache was created, the cache is invalid\&. "

.br
.RI "The \fBSoConvexDataCache\fP class is used to cache convexified polygons\&.
.PP
\fBSoConvexDataCache\fP is used to speed up rendering of concave polygons by tessellating all polygons into triangles and storing the newly generated primitives in an internal cache\&. "
