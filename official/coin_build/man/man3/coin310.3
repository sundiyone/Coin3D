coin310New Features in Coin v3\&.1\&.0 
 \- This is a brief summary of the new features in Coin v3\&.1\&.0:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
Default transparency type for \fBSoGLRenderAction\fP changed from SCREEN_DOOR to BLEND\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBSoBase\fP will not keep a list of unnamed / empty named nodes any more\&. This is both an optimization and improves conformance to SGI / TGS Inventor\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBSbTesselator\fP does better when handed certain polygons, due to improved precision in internal calculations\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Resource usage pressure significantly lower for common case scene graphs with regard to mutex allocations\&. A not entirely uncommon problem on MS Windows systems for huge scene graphs was that the run-time system ran out of available mutexes -- this is now very unlikely to happen\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Builds with G++ and MSVC will have C++ exception support enabled by default\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBSoSceneManager\fP render callback can be set to NULL to disable it\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Non-power-of-two textures are automatically supported if the OpenGL driver has that feature\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
No other intentional differences in semantics, other than for any bugs fixed\&.
