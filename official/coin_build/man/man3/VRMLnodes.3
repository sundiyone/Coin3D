.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Nodes implementaing the VRML97 standard\&. 

This is the set of items specified by VRML97, also known as VRML2\&.0\&. These nodes are different from VRML1/Inventor nodes in the way you structure them into scene-graphs, and in the requirements they set for traversing them correctly (VRML1/Inventor require that you traverse siblings on the left side before the node of interest, while for VRML2\&.0 this is not true)\&.
.PP
You can find out more about VRML97 in \fBThe Annotated VRML2\&.0 Reference Manual\fP\&.
.PP
The VRML97 specification is online at http://www.web3d.org/x3d/specifications/vrml/
