.RI "The \fBSoButtonEvent\fP class is the base class for all button events\&.
.PP
The event classes which results from the user pushing buttons on some device (keyboard, mouse or spaceball) all inherit this class\&. The \fBSoButtonEvent\fP class contains methods for setting and getting the state of the button(s)\&. "

.RI "The \fBSoEvent\fP class is the base class for all Coin events\&.
.PP
Coin contains its own set of event classes, independent of the underlying window system\&. "

.RI "class \fBSoKeyboardEvent\fP"
.br
.RI "The \fBSoKeyboardEvent\fP class contains information about keyboard interaction\&.
.PP
When the user presses any keys on the keyboard, these will be translated from a system specific event into a Coin event and sent to the scenegraph by using instances of this class\&. "

.RI "class \fBSoLocation2Event\fP"
.br
.RI "The \fBSoLocation2Event\fP class contains information about 2D movement events\&.
.PP
Location2 events are generated by devices capable of 2D, e\&.g\&. pointer devices -- typically computer mice\&. Instances of this class contains information about the position of the pointer on the render area\&. "

.RI "The \fBSoMotion3Event\fP class contains information about 3D movement events\&.
.PP
Motion3 events are generated by devices capable of '3D motion', for instance spaceballs\&. Instances of this class contains information about these devices' translations and rotations in all 3 dimensions\&. "

.RI "The \fBSoMouseButtonEvent\fP class contains information about mousebutton interaction\&.
.PP

.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
These classes are te event types you can send to a scene graph through the \fBSoHandleEventAction\fP\&. 

They are a pretty direct mapping from the various system event types you will have on all the host architectures\&.
