The PointSet node specifies a set of 3D points, in the local coordinate system, with associated colours at each point\&. The coord field specifies a \fBSoVRMLCoordinate\fP node (or instance of a Coordinate node)\&. The results are undefined if the coord field specifies any other type of node\&. PointSet uses the coordinates in order\&. If the coord field is NULL, the point set is considered empty\&. PointSet nodes are not lit, not texture-mapped, nor do they participate in collision detection\&. The size of each point is implementation- dependent\&. If the color field is not NULL, it shall specify a \fBSoVRMLColor\fP node that contains at least the number of points contained in the coord node\&. The results are undefined if the color field specifies any other type of node\&. Colours shall be applied to each point in order\&. The results are undefined if the number of values in the Color node is less than the number of values specified in the Coordinate node\&. If the color field is NULL and there is a \fBSoVRMLMaterial\fP node defined for the \fBSoVRMLAppearance\fP node affecting this PointSet node, the emissiveColor of the Material node shall be used to draw the points\&. More details on lighting equations can be found in 4\&.14, Lighting model (http://www.web3d.org/x3d/specifications/vrml/ISO-IEC-14772-VRML97/part1/concepts.html#4.14)\&.

.PP
Returns the type identification of an object derived from a class inheriting \fBSoBase\fP\&. This is used for run-time type checking and 'downward' casting\&. Usage example:
.PP
.PP
.nf
void foo(SoNode * node)
{
  if (node->getTypeId() == SoFile::getClassTypeId()) {
    SoFile * filenode = (SoFile *)node;  // safe downward cast, knows the type
  }
}
.fi

.PP
For application programmers wanting to extend the library with new nodes, engines, nodekits, draggers or others: this method needs to be overridden in \fIall\fP subclasses\&. This is typically done as part of setting up the full type system for extension classes, which is usually accomplished by using the pre-defined macros available through for instance \fBInventor/nodes/SoSubNode\&.h\fP (SO_NODE_INIT_CLASS and SO_NODE_CONSTRUCTOR for node classes), \fBInventor/engines/SoSubEngine\&.h\fP (for engine classes) and so on\&.

.PP
Reimplemented from \fBSoVRMLVertexPoint\fP\&.
.SS "const \fBSoFieldData\fP * SoVRMLPointSet::getFieldData (void) const\fC [protected]\fP, \fC [virtual]\fP"
Returns a pointer to the class-wide field data storage object for this instance\&. If no fields are present, returns \fCNULL\fP\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBSoVRMLVertexPoint\fP\&.
.SS "void SoVRMLPointSet::GLRender (\fBSoGLRenderAction\fP * action)\fC [virtual]\fP"
Action method for the \fBSoGLRenderAction\fP\&.
.PP
This is called during rendering traversals\&. Nodes influencing the rendering state in any way or who wants to throw geometry primitives at OpenGL overrides this method\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBSoVRMLVertexPoint\fP\&.
.SS "void SoVRMLPointSet::getBoundingBox (\fBSoGetBoundingBoxAction\fP * action)\fC [virtual]\fP"
Action method for the \fBSoGetBoundingBoxAction\fP\&.
.PP
Calculates bounding box and center coordinates for node and modifies the values of the \fIaction\fP to encompass the bounding box for this node and to shift the center point for the scene more towards the one for this node\&.
.PP
Nodes influencing how geometry nodes calculates their bounding box also overrides this method to change the relevant state variables\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBSoVRMLVertexPoint\fP\&.
.SS "void SoVRMLPointSet::generatePrimitives (\fBSoAction\fP * action)\fC [protected]\fP, \fC [virtual]\fP"
The method implements action behavior for shape nodes for \fBSoCallbackAction\fP\&. It is invoked from \fBSoShape::callback()\fP\&. (Subclasses should \fInot\fP override \fBSoNode::callback()\fP\&.)
.PP
The subclass implementations uses the convenience methods \fBSoShape::beginShape()\fP, \fBSoShape::shapeVertex()\fP, and \fBSoShape::endShape()\fP, with \fBSoDetail\fP instances, to pass the primitives making up the shape back to the caller\&. 
.PP
Implements \fBSoShape\fP\&.
