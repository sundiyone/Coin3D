.RI "The \fBSbCylinderPlaneProjector\fP class projects 2D points to a half-cylinder and a plane\&.
.PP
This projector uses a plane along with the half-cylinder of \fBSbCylinderSectionProjector\fP for projections\&. If the 2D point mapping 'misses' the cylinder section, the 3D point will be projected onto the plane\&. "

.RI "The \fBSbCylinderSectionProjector\fP projects 2D points to a sliced cylinder\&.
.PP
The projection cylinder for this class is sliced by a clipping plane parallel to its height axis\&. Projections will be mapped to the remaining cylinder part\&. "

.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
The projector classes are used to convert between screenspace (2D) locations and locations in worldspace (3D)\&. 

They are mostly used in relation to user interaction with the mouse in the viewport\&.
