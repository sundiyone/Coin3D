a type information library for Coin types and their relations\&. 

SbTypeInfo<> makes it possible to write generic code using Coin types that is able to adjust itself to the parameter types used\&. Usually you would be able to do that quite easily if the Sb-classes had been template classes of Type and Dimension arguments\&. This type library makes it possible to work around that lack of genericity by looking up type relationships instead\&.

Certain inside types of SbTypeInfo<> are always defined\&. Others will only be defined if the template argument type is of certain characteristics\&.
.PP
Type is the type the SbTypeInfo<>-specialization is for\&. It is always defined\&.

ParamType is a type deemed to be efficient for function parameter transfer\&. It is always defined\&.
