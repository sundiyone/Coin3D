.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
The \fBSoFile\fP class is node container for another model file\&.
.PP
This node provides a way to split your models into a set of 'component' models to include into larger 'master' files\&. 

Just provide the name of the model file to include in the \fBSoFile::name\fP field, and it will automatically be loaded and have its nodes inserted into the scenegraph at the point of the \fBSoFile\fP node\&.
.PP
You can also set the \fBSoFile::name\fP field manually\&. Such an action will then automatically trigger an invocation of a read operation which imports the filename you set in the field\&.

.PP
Returns the type identification of an object derived from a class inheriting \fBSoBase\fP\&. This is used for run-time type checking and 'downward' casting\&. Usage example:
.PP
.PP
.nf
void foo(SoNode * node)
{
  if (node->getTypeId() == SoFile::getClassTypeId()) {
    SoFile * filenode = (SoFile *)node;  // safe downward cast, knows the type
  }
}
.fi
.PP
.PP
For application programmers wanting to extend the library with new nodes, engines, nodekits, draggers or others: this method needs to be overridden in \fIall\fP subclasses\&. This is typically done as part of setting up the full type system for extension classes, which is usually accomplished by using the pre-defined macros available through for instance \fBInventor/nodes/SoSubNode\&.h\fP (SO_NODE_INIT_CLASS and SO_NODE_CONSTRUCTOR for node classes), \fBInventor/engines/SoSubEngine\&.h\fP (for engine classes) and so on\&.
.PP
For more information on writing Coin extensions, see the class documentation of the toplevel superclasses for the various class groups\&. 
.PP
Implements \fBSoBase\fP\&.
.SS "const \fBSoFieldData\fP * SoFile::getFieldData (void) const\fC [protected]\fP, \fC [virtual]\fP"

.SS "void SoFile::callback (\fBSoCallbackAction\fP * action)\fC [virtual]\fP"
Action method for \fBSoCallbackAction\fP\&.
.PP
Simply updates the state according to how the node behaves for the render action, so the application programmer can use the \fBSoCallbackAction\fP for extracting information about the scene graph\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBSoNode\fP\&.
.SS "void SoFile::GLRender (\fBSoGLRenderAction\fP * action)\fC [virtual]\fP"
Action method for the \fBSoGLRenderAction\fP\&.

This is called during rendering traversals\&. Nodes influencing the rendering state in any way or who wants to throw geometry primitives at OpenGL overrides this method\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBSoNode\fP\&.
.SS "void SoFile::getBoundingBox (\fBSoGetBoundingBoxAction\fP * action)\fC [virtual]\fP"
Action method for the \fBSoGetBoundingBoxAction\fP\&.
.PP
Calculates bounding box and center coordinates for node and modifies the values of the \fIaction\fP to encompass the bounding box for this node and to shift the center point for the scene more towards the one for this node\&.
.PP
Nodes influencing how geometry nodes calculates their bounding box also overrides this method to change the relevant state variables\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBSoNode\fP\&.
.SS "void SoFile::getMatrix (\fBSoGetMatrixAction\fP * action)\fC [virtual]\fP"
Action method for \fBSoGetMatrixAction\fP\&.
.PP
Updates \fIaction\fP by accumulating with the transformation matrix of this node (if any)\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBSoNode\fP\&.
.SS "void SoFile::handleEvent (\fBSoHandleEventAction\fP * action)\fC [virtual]\fP"
Action method for \fBSoHandleEventAction\fP\&.
.PP
Inspects the event data from \fIaction\fP, and processes it if it is something which this node should react to\&.
.PP
Nodes influencing relevant state variables for how event handling is done also overrides this method\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBSoNode\fP\&.
.SS "void SoFile::pick (\fBSoPickAction\fP * action)\fC [virtual]\fP"
Action method for \fBSoPickAction\fP\&.
.PP
Does common processing for \fBSoPickAction\fP \fIaction\fP instances\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBSoNode\fP\&.
.SS "void SoFile::getPrimitiveCount (\fBSoGetPrimitiveCountAction\fP * action)\fC [virtual]\fP"
Action method for the \fBSoGetPrimitiveCountAction\fP\&.
.PP
Calculates the number of triangle, line segment and point primitives for the node and adds these to the counters of the \fIaction\fP\&.
.PP
Nodes influencing how geometry nodes calculates their primitive count also overrides this method to change the relevant state variables\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBSoNode\fP\&.
.SS "void SoFile::audioRender (\fBSoAudioRenderAction\fP * action)\fC [virtual]\fP"
Action method for \fBSoAudioRenderAction\fP\&.
.PP
Does common processing for \fBSoAudioRenderAction\fP \fIaction\fP instances\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBSoNode\fP\&.
.SS "void SoFile::search (\fBSoSearchAction\fP * action)\fC [virtual]\fP"
Action method for \fBSoSearchAction\fP\&.
.PP
Compares the search criteria from the \fIaction\fP to see if this node is a match\&. Searching is done by matching up \fIall\fP criteria set up in the \fBSoSearchAction\fP -- if \fIany\fP of the requested criteria is a miss, the search is not deemed successful for the node\&.

Reimplemented from \fBSoNode\fP\&.
.SS "\fBSoGroup\fP * SoFile::copyChildren (void) const"
Returns a subgraph with a deep copy of the children of this node\&. 
.SS "\fBSoChildList\fP * SoFile::getChildren (void) const\fC [virtual]\fP"
Returns list of children for this node\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBSoNode\fP\&.
.SS "void SoFile::copyContents (const \fBSoFieldContainer\fP * from, SbBool copyconnections)\fC [virtual]\fP"
Makes a deep copy of all data of \fIfrom\fP into this instance, \fIexcept\fP external scenegraph references if \fIcopyconnections\fP is \fCFALSE\fP\&.
.PP
This is the method that should be overridden by extension node / engine / dragger / whatever subclasses which needs to account for internal data that are not handled automatically\&.
.PP
For copying nodes from application code, you should not invoke this function directly, but rather call the \fBSoNode::copy()\fP function:
.PP
.PP
.nf
SoNode * mynewnode = templatenode->copy();
.fi
.PP
.PP
The same also goes for engines\&.
.PP
Make sure that when you override the \fBcopyContents()\fP method in your extension class that you also make it call upwards to it's parent superclass in the inheritance hierarchy, as \fBcopyContents()\fP in for instance \fBSoNode\fP and \fBSoFieldContainer\fP does important work\&. It should go something like this:
.PP
.PP
.nf
void
MyCoinExtensionNode::copyContents(const SoFieldContainer * from,
                                  SbBool copyconnections)
{
  // let parent superclasses do their thing (copy fields, copy
  // instance name, etc etc)
  SoNode::copyContents(from, copyconnections);

  // [\&.\&.then copy internal data\&.\&.]
}
.fi
.PP
 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBSoNode\fP\&.
.SS "const \fBSbString\fP & SoFile::getFullName (void) const"
Returns the read filename, possibly including the (relative) path where the file was found\&. Returns an empty string if no file has been read\&.
.PP
This method is an extension versus the Open Inventor API\&. 
.SS "void SoFile::setSearchOK (SbBool dosearch)\fC [static]\fP"
Enables/disables searching children using \fBSoSearchAction\fP\&. 
.SS "SbBool SoFile::getSearchOK ()\fC [static]\fP"
Returns whether searching children using \fBSoSearchAction\fP is enabled\&. 
.SS "SbBool SoFile::readInstance (\fBSoInput\fP * in, unsigned short flags)\fC [protected]\fP, \fC [virtual]\fP"
This method is mainly intended for internal use during file import operations\&.
.PP
It reads a definition of an instance from the input stream \fIin\fP\&. The input stream state points to the start of a serialized / persistant representation of an instance of this class type\&.
.PP
\fCTRUE\fP or \fCFALSE\fP is returned, depending on if the instantiation and configuration of the new object of this class type went ok or not\&. The import process should be robust and handle corrupted input streams by returning \fCFALSE\fP\&.
.PP
\fIflags\fP is used internally during binary import when reading user extension nodes, group nodes or engines\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBSoNode\fP\&.
.SS "SbBool SoFile::readNamedFile (\fBSoInput\fP * in)\fC [protected]\fP, \fC [virtual]\fP"
Read the file named in the \fBSoFile::name\fP field\&.
.PP
Used to be a private method, moved into protected space to enable subclasses to detect when the file is (re)read\&.
