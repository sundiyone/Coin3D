.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
The \fBSoAudioDevice\fP class is used to control an audio device\&.
.PP
The \fBSoAudioDevice\fP class is responsible for initialization of an audio device, as well as enabling and disabling sound\&. It is a singleton class\&. 

The application programmer does not need to use this class directly, as audio support is enabled by default, and the default settings are reasonable\&.
.PP
Coin uses OpenAL (http://www.openal.org/, http://developer.soundblaster.com [Games section]) to render audio\&. OpenAL should work with any soundcard, and on most modern operating systems (including Unix, Linux, IRIX, *BSD, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows)\&. 2 speaker output is always available, and on some OS and soundcard combinations, more advanced speaker configurations are supported\&. On Microsoft Windows, OpenAL can use DirectSound3D to render audio, thus supporting any speaker configuration the current DirectSound3D driver supports\&. Configuring speakers are done through the soundcard driver, and is transparent to both Coin and OpenAL\&. 
.SH "Member Function Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "\fBSoAudioDevice\fP * SoAudioDevice::instance ()\fC [static]\fP"
Returns a pointer to the \fBSoAudioDevice\fP class, which is a singleton\&. 
.SS "SbBool SoAudioDevice::init (const \fBSbString\fP & devicetype, const \fBSbString\fP & devicename)"
Initializes the audio device\&. Currently, the only supported \fIdevicetype\fP is 'OpenAL'\&. The supported \fIdevicename\fP depends on the OS and on installed soundcards and drivers\&. On Microsoft Windows, supported device names are 'DirectSound3D', 'DirectSound', and 'MMSYSTEM'\&. See OpenAL documentation (available from http://www.openal.org/) for further information\&.
.PP
The application programmer may override the default setting by calling this method with the wanted device type and name\&.
.PP
The user can also control which \fIdevicename\fP OpenAL uses by setting the COIN_SOUND_DRIVER_NAME environment variable\&. On Microsoft Windows, the default driver name is 'DirectSound3D', which should normally be what the user wants\&. 
.SS "SbBool SoAudioDevice::enable ()"
Enables sound 
.SS "void SoAudioDevice::disable ()"
Disables sound\&. Effectively silencing all audio output\&. 
.SS "SbBool SoAudioDevice::isEnabled (void)"
Returns TRUE if audio is enabled\&. 
.SS "SbBool SoAudioDevice::haveSound ()"
returns true if the audio device has been initialized successfully\&.
