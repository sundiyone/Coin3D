.SH NAME
SoDetail \- The \fBSoDetail\fP class is the superclass for all classes storing detailed information about particular shapes\&.
.PP
Detail information about shapes is used in relation to picking actions in Coin\&. They typically contain the relevant information about what particular part of the shape a pick ray intersected with\&.

.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
The \fBSoDetail\fP class is the superclass for all classes storing detailed information about particular shapes\&.
.PP
Detail information about shapes is used in relation to picking actions in Coin\&. They typically contain the relevant information about what particular part of the shape a pick ray intersected with\&. 
.SH "Constructor & Destructor Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "SoDetail::~SoDetail ()\fC [virtual]\fP"
Destructor\&. 
.SS "SoDetail::SoDetail (void)\fC [protected]\fP"
Default constructor\&. 
.SH "Member Function Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "void SoDetail::initClass (void)\fC [static]\fP"
Initialize relevant common data for all instances, like the type system\&. 
.SS "void SoDetail::initClasses (void)\fC [static]\fP"
Call the \fBinitClass()\fP methods of all built-in detail classes\&.
.PP
(The \fBinitClass()\fP method of user extension detail classes -- if any -- must be called explicitly by the application programmer in the application initialization code\&.) 
.SS "\fBSoDetail\fP * SoDetail::copy (void) const\fC [pure virtual]\fP"
Return a deep copy of ourself\&.
.PP
\fBNote that if the Coin library has been built as a DLL under Microsoft Windows and you use this method from application code, you \fImust\fP make sure that both the Coin DLL and the application executable is using the same instance of a C Run-Time (CRT) library\&. Otherwise, you \fIwill\fP get memory heap corruption upon deallocating the returned instances, eventually leading to mysterious crashes\&.\fP 
.PP
Implemented in \fBSoNodeKitDetail\fP, \fBSoLineDetail\fP, \fBSoFaceDetail\fP, \fBSoTextDetail\fP, \fBSoCubeDetail\fP, \fBSoCylinderDetail\fP, \fBSoConeDetail\fP, and \fBSoPointDetail\fP\&.
.SS "\fBSoType\fP SoDetail::getTypeId (void) const\fC [pure virtual]\fP"
Returns the type identification of a detail derived from a class inheriting \fBSoDetail\fP\&. This is used for run-time type checking and 'downward' casting\&.
.PP
Usage example:
.PP
.PP
.nf
void fuhbear(SoDetail * detail)
{
  if (detail->getTypeId() == SoFaceDetail::getClassTypeId()) {
    // safe downward cast, know the type
    SoFaceDetail * facedetail = (SoFaceDetail *)detail;
  }
  return; // ignore if not a SoFaceDetail
}
.fi
.PP
.PP
For application programmers wanting to extend the library with new detail classes: this method needs to be overridden in \fIall\fP subclasses\&. This is typically done as part of setting up the full type system for extension classes, which is usually accomplished by using the pre-defined macros available through Inventor/nodes/SoSubDetail\&.h: SO_DETAIL_SOURCE and SO_DETAIL_INIT_CLASS\&. 
.PP
Implemented in \fBSoNodeKitDetail\fP, \fBSoPointDetail\fP, \fBSoLineDetail\fP, \fBSoFaceDetail\fP, \fBSoTextDetail\fP, \fBSoCubeDetail\fP, \fBSoCylinderDetail\fP, and \fBSoConeDetail\fP\&.
.SS "SbBool SoDetail::isOfType (const \fBSoType\fP type) const"
Returns \fCTRUE\fP if \fItype\fP is derived from (or \fIis\fP) this class\&. 
.SS "\fBSoType\fP SoDetail::getClassTypeId (void)\fC [static]\fP"
Returns the type for this class\&.
