.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
The \fBSoGate\fP class is used to selectively copy values from input to output\&.
.PP
This engine will forward values from the \fBSoGate::input\fP field to the \fBSoGate::output\fP field when the \fBSoGate::enable\fP field is \fCTRUE\fP\&. 

Note that this engine's output field deviates a little from the 'standard' output mechanism of the majority of engine classes: the \fBSoGate::output\fP is not a permanent \fBSoEngineOutput\fP instance, but a \fIpointer\fP to a \fBSoEngineOutput\fP instance\&. The reason for this is that it is necessary to allocate the output field dynamically to make it match what the \fBSoGate::input\fP is connected to since the type of the \fBSoGate::output\fP always should be the same as the type of the \fBSoGate::input\fP\&.
.PP
The file format for this field is a bit special\&. Note the leading type specification, which is not necessary for most other field types:
.PP
.PP
.nf
Gate {
  type <multivaluefieldtype>
  [...fields...]
}
.fi
.PP
 
.SH "Constructor & Destructor Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "SoGate::SoGate (\fBSoType\fP type)"
Constructor\&. The type of the input/output is specified in \fItype\fP\&. 
.SH "Member Function Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "virtual \fBSoType\fP SoGate::getTypeId (void) const\fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Returns the type identification of an object derived from a class inheriting \fBSoBase\fP\&. This is used for run-time type checking and 'downward' casting\&. Usage example:
.PP
.PP
.nf
void foo(SoNode * node)
{
  if (node->getTypeId() == SoFile::getClassTypeId()) {
    SoFile * filenode = (SoFile *)node;  // safe downward cast, knows the type
  }
}
.fi
.PP
.PP
For application programmers wanting to extend the library with new nodes, engines, nodekits, draggers or others: this method needs to be overridden in \fIall\fP subclasses\&. This is typically done as part of setting up the full type system for extension classes, which is usually accomplished by using the pre-defined macros available through for instance \fBInventor/nodes/SoSubNode\&.h\fP (SO_NODE_INIT_CLASS and SO_NODE_CONSTRUCTOR for node classes), \fBInventor/engines/SoSubEngine\&.h\fP (for engine classes) and so on\&.
.PP
For more information on writing Coin extensions, see the class documentation of the toplevel superclasses for the various class groups\&. 
.PP
Implements \fBSoBase\fP\&.
.SS "virtual const \fBSoFieldData\fP* SoGate::getFieldData (void) const\fC [virtual]\fP"
Returns a pointer to the class-wide field data storage object for this instance\&. If no fields are present, returns \fCNULL\fP\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBSoFieldContainer\fP\&.
.SS "virtual const \fBSoEngineOutputData\fP* SoGate::getOutputData (void) const\fC [virtual]\fP"
\fIThis API member is considered internal to the library, as it is not likely to be of interest to the application programmer\&.\fP 
.PP
Implements \fBSoEngine\fP\&.
.SS "void SoGate::inputChanged (\fBSoField\fP * which)\fC [protected]\fP, \fC [virtual]\fP"
Called when an input is changed\&. The default method does nothing, but subclasses may override this method to do The Right Thing when a specific field is changed\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBSoEngine\fP\&.
.SH "Member Data Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "\fBSoSFBool\fP SoGate::enable"
Set whether or not to forward from input to output field\&. 
.SS "\fBSoSFTrigger\fP SoGate::trigger"
Copy the current values of the input field once to the output field\&. 
.SS "\fBSoMField\fP * SoGate::input"
The multivalue input field which we will forward to the output when \fBSoGate::enable\fP is \fCTRUE\fP\&. 
.SS "\fBSoEngineOutput\fP * SoGate::output"
(\fBSoMField\fP) This is the field output containing the values of \fBSoGate::input\fP\&.
.PP
The type of the field will of course match the type of the input field\&.
