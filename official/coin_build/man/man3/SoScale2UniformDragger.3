.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
The \fBSoScale2UniformDragger\fP class provides a mechanism for the end-user to scale in two dimensions\&.
.PP
Here's how the dragger looks with its default geometry in the inactive state: 

 Screen Shot of Default Dragger
.PP
Use this dragger to allow the end-user of your application to scale along the X-axis and the Y-axis\&. (Use a transformation node in front of the dragger to position it and re-orient it to scale in any plane\&.)
.PP
Scaling with this dragger can only be done in a uniform manner, ie the X component of the \fBSoScale2UniformDragger::scaleFactor\fP will always equal the Y component\&.
.PP
For non-uniform scaling operations in 2 dimensions, use the \fBSoScale2Dragger\fP\&.

.SS "SoScale2UniformDragger::~SoScale2UniformDragger (void)\fC [protected]\fP, \fC [virtual]\fP"
Protected destructor\&.
.PP
(Dragger classes are derived from \fBSoBase\fP, so they are reference counted and automatically destroyed when their reference count goes to 0\&.) 
.SH "Member Function Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "\fBSoType\fP SoScale2UniformDragger::getTypeId (void) const\fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Returns the type identification of an object derived from a class inheriting \fBSoBase\fP\&. This is used for run-time type checking and 'downward' casting\&. Usage example:
.PP
.PP
.nf
void foo(SoNode * node)
{
  if (node->getTypeId() == SoFile::getClassTypeId()) {
    SoFile * filenode = (SoFile *)node;  // safe downward cast, knows the type
  }
}
.fi
.PP
.PP
For application programmers wanting to extend the library with new nodes, engines, nodekits, draggers or others: this method needs to be overridden in \fIall\fP subclasses\&. This is typically done as part of setting up the full type system for extension classes, which is usually accomplished by using the pre-defined macros available through for instance \fBInventor/nodes/SoSubNode\&.h\fP (SO_NODE_INIT_CLASS and SO_NODE_CONSTRUCTOR for node classes), \fBInventor/engines/SoSubEngine\&.h\fP (for engine classes) and so on\&.

.SS "const \fBSoFieldData\fP * SoScale2UniformDragger::getFieldData (void) const\fC [protected]\fP, \fC [virtual]\fP"
Returns a pointer to the class-wide field data storage object for this instance\&. If no fields are present, returns \fCNULL\fP\&. 
.PP

.SS "const \fBSoNodekitCatalog\fP * SoScale2UniformDragger::getNodekitCatalog (void) const\fC [virtual]\fP"
