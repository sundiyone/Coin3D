.PP 
The fields are the data containers in the scene graph\&. Nodes and engines all use fields to store their public data\&. 

Fields can be inter-connected, causing changes at one location in a scene graph to cause other parts of the scene graph to automatically also get updated\&. Direct field-to-field connections will cause values to get duplicated, while field connections together with engines can create complex networks for such updating that include mathematical computations and logical operations\&. Field connections are uni-directional, but setting up a connection in both directions will cause a bi-directional connection\&.
.PP
Fields are first divided into two groups; 'single fields' and 'multi
fields'\&. Single-fields contain just one value, while multi-fields can contain many values or even none at all\&.
.PP
Besides fields that are part of nodes, you also have 'global fields'\&. The 'realtime' field is one such field\&.
.PP
The fields in VRML97 nodes have additional semantics\&. Some are 'event_in' and some are 'event_out', listening for events or triggering events\&. 'event_in' events should not be read from, and 'event_out' fields should not be written to\&.
