.SH NAME
SoOneShotSensor \- The \fBSoOneShotSensor\fP class is a sensor which will trigger once\&.
.PP
Since \fBSoOneShotSensor\fP is a subclass of \fBSoDelayQueueSensor\fP, it will trigger as soon as either the run-time system is idle, or if it is continually busy it will trigger within a fixed amount of time (this is by default 1/12th of a second, see \fBSoSensorManager::setDelaySensorTimeout()\fP)\&.
