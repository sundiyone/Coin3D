.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
The \fBSoDirectionalLightManip\fP class is used to manipulate \fBSoDirectionalLight\fP nodes\&.
.PP
A manipulator is used by replacing the node you want to edit in the graph with the manipulator\&. Draggers are used to manipulate the node\&. When manipulation is finished, the node is put back into the graph, replacing the manipulator\&. 

 Example of DirectionalLight Manipulator 
.SH "Constructor & Destructor Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "SoDirectionalLightManip::SoDirectionalLightManip (void)"
The constructor sets up the internal SoDiretionalLightDragger used by the manipulator\&. 
.SS "SoDirectionalLightManip::~SoDirectionalLightManip (void)\fC [protected]\fP, \fC [virtual]\fP"
Destructor\&. Clean up resources used by manipulator\&. 
.SH "Member Function Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "\fBSoType\fP SoDirectionalLightManip::getTypeId (void) const\fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Returns the type identification of an object derived from a class inheriting \fBSoBase\fP\&. This is used for run-time type checking and 'downward' casting\&. Usage example:
.PP
.PP
.nf
void foo(SoNode * node)
{
  if (node->getTypeId() == SoFile::getClassTypeId()) {
    SoFile * filenode = (SoFile *)node;  // safe downward cast, knows the type
  }
}
.fi
.PP
.PP
For application programmers wanting to extend the library with new nodes, engines, nodekits, draggers or others: this method needs to be overridden in \fIall\fP subclasses\&. This is typically done as part of setting up the full type system for extension classes, which is usually accomplished by using the pre-defined macros available through for instance \fBInventor/nodes/SoSubNode\&.h\fP (SO_NODE_INIT_CLASS and SO_NODE_CONSTRUCTOR for node classes), \fBInventor/engines/SoSubEngine\&.h\fP (for engine classes) and so on\&.
.PP
For more information on writing Coin extensions, see the class documentation of the toplevel superclasses for the various class groups\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBSoDirectionalLight\fP\&.
.SS "const \fBSoFieldData\fP * SoDirectionalLightManip::getFieldData (void) const\fC [protected]\fP, \fC [virtual]\fP"
Returns a pointer to the class-wide field data storage object for this instance\&. If no fields are present, returns \fCNULL\fP\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBSoDirectionalLight\fP\&.
.SS "\fBSoDragger\fP * SoDirectionalLightManip::getDragger (void)"
Return pointer to internal \fBSoDirectionalLightDragger\fP dragger\&. 
.SS "SbBool SoDirectionalLightManip::replaceNode (\fBSoPath\fP * path)"
Replaces the node specified by \fIpath\fP with this manipulator\&. The manipulator will copy the field data from the node, to make it affect the state in the same way as the node\&. 
.SS "SbBool SoDirectionalLightManip::replaceManip (\fBSoPath\fP * path, \fBSoDirectionalLight\fP * newone) const"
Replaces this manipulator from the position specified by \fIpath\fP with \fInewnode\fP\&. If \fInewnode\fP is \fCNULL\fP, an \fBSoDirectionalLight\fP will be created for you\&. 
.SS "void SoDirectionalLightManip::doAction (\fBSoAction\fP * action)\fC [virtual]\fP"
This function performs the typical operation of a node for any action\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBSoNode\fP\&.
.SS "void SoDirectionalLightManip::callback (\fBSoCallbackAction\fP * action)\fC [virtual]\fP"
Action method for \fBSoCallbackAction\fP\&.
.PP
Simply updates the state according to how the node behaves for the render action, so the application programmer can use the \fBSoCallbackAction\fP for extracting information about the scene graph\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBSoLight\fP\&.
.SS "void SoDirectionalLightManip::GLRender (\fBSoGLRenderAction\fP * action)\fC [virtual]\fP"
Action method for the \fBSoGLRenderAction\fP\&.
.PP
This is called during rendering traversals\&. Nodes influencing the rendering state in any way or who wants to throw geometry primitives at OpenGL overrides this method\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBSoDirectionalLight\fP\&.
.SS "void SoDirectionalLightManip::getBoundingBox (\fBSoGetBoundingBoxAction\fP * action)\fC [virtual]\fP"
Action method for the \fBSoGetBoundingBoxAction\fP\&.
.PP
Calculates bounding box and center coordinates for node and modifies the values of the \fIaction\fP to encompass the bounding box for this node and to shift the center point for the scene more towards the one for this node\&.
.PP
Nodes influencing how geometry nodes calculates their bounding box also overrides this method to change the relevant state variables\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBSoNode\fP\&.
.SS "void SoDirectionalLightManip::getMatrix (\fBSoGetMatrixAction\fP * action)\fC [virtual]\fP"
Action method for \fBSoGetMatrixAction\fP\&.
.PP
Updates \fIaction\fP by accumulating with the transformation matrix of this node (if any)\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBSoNode\fP\&.
.SS "void SoDirectionalLightManip::handleEvent (\fBSoHandleEventAction\fP * action)\fC [virtual]\fP"
Action method for \fBSoHandleEventAction\fP\&.
.PP
Inspects the event data from \fIaction\fP, and processes it if it is something which this node should react to\&.
.PP
Nodes influencing relevant state variables for how event handling is done also overrides this method\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBSoNode\fP\&.
.SS "void SoDirectionalLightManip::pick (\fBSoPickAction\fP * action)\fC [virtual]\fP"
Action method for \fBSoPickAction\fP\&.
.PP
Does common processing for \fBSoPickAction\fP \fIaction\fP instances\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBSoNode\fP\&.
.SS "void SoDirectionalLightManip::search (\fBSoSearchAction\fP * action)\fC [virtual]\fP"
Action method for \fBSoSearchAction\fP\&.
.PP
Compares the search criteria from the \fIaction\fP to see if this node is a match\&. Searching is done by matching up \fIall\fP criteria set up in the \fBSoSearchAction\fP -- if \fIany\fP of the requested criteria is a miss, the search is not deemed successful for the node\&.

.PP
Reimplemented from \fBSoNode\fP\&.
.SS "\fBSoChildList\fP * SoDirectionalLightManip::getChildren (void) const\fC [virtual]\fP"
Returns the children of this node\&. This node only has the dragger as a child\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBSoNode\fP\&.
.SS "void SoDirectionalLightManip::setDragger (\fBSoDragger\fP * newdragger)\fC [protected]\fP"
Set dragger to be used by this manipulator\&. 
.SS "void SoDirectionalLightManip::copyContents (const \fBSoFieldContainer\fP * from, SbBool copyconnections)\fC [protected]\fP, \fC [virtual]\fP"
Makes a deep copy of all data of \fIfrom\fP into this instance, \fIexcept\fP external scenegraph references if \fIcopyconnections\fP is \fCFALSE\fP\&.
.PP
This is the method that should be overridden by extension node / engine / dragger / whatever subclasses which needs to account for internal data that are not handled automatically\&.
.PP
For copying nodes from application code, you should not invoke this function directly, but rather call the \fBSoNode::copy()\fP function:
.PP
.PP
.nf
SoNode * mynewnode = templatenode->copy();
.fi
.PP
.PP
The same also goes for engines\&.
.PP
Make sure that when you override the \fBcopyContents()\fP method in your extension class that you also make it call upwards to it's parent superclass in the inheritance hierarchy, as \fBcopyContents()\fP in for instance \fBSoNode\fP and \fBSoFieldContainer\fP does important work\&. It should go something like this:
.PP
.PP
.nf
void
MyCoinExtensionNode::copyContents(const SoFieldContainer * from,
                                  SbBool copyconnections)
{
  // let parent superclasses do their thing (copy fields, copy
  // instance name, etc etc)
  SoNode::copyContents(from, copyconnections);

  // [\&.\&.then copy internal data\&.\&.]
}
.fi
