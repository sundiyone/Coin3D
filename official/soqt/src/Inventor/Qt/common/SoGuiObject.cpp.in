  \class So@Gui@Object Inventor/@Gui@/So@Gui@Object.h
  \brief The So@Gui@Object class is the common superclass for all So@Gui@ component classes.
  \ingroup misc

  The purpose of making this class the superclass of all So@Gui@
  device, component and viewer classes is to be able to do run-time
  type checking of the So@Gui@ objects.


  You can place the macro SO@GUI@_OBJECT_HEADER(classname,parentname)
  within a class definition header for So@Gui@ extension components to
  automatically make the necessary definitions for setting up a
  run-time type system for your extension classes:

  \code
  #ifndef MYSPECIALVIEWER_H
  #define MYSPECIALVIEWER_H

  class MySpecialViewer : public So@Gui@ExaminerViewer {
    SO@GUI@_OBJECT_HEADER(MySpecialViewer, So@Gui@ExaminerViewer);
    // [rest of class definition follows]
  };

  #endif // !MYSPECIALVIEWER_H
  \endcode

  Then put the SO@GUI@_OBJECT_SOURCE(classname) macro within the
  actual implementation sourcecode file to include the necessary
  code for the run-time type system:

  \code
  #include <MySpecialViewer.h>

  SOQT_OBJECT_SOURCE(MySpecialViewer);

  // [rest of class implementation]
  \endcode


  See also the documentation of the SoType class in Coin or Inventor.

// *************************************************************************

/*!
  \fn SoType So@Gui@Object::getTypeId

  Returns the type identification of an object derived from a class
  inheriting So@Gui@Object.  This is used for run-time type checking
  and "downward" casting.

  Usage example:

  \code
  void foo(So@Gui@Viewer * comp)
  {
    if (comp->getTypeId() == So@Gui@ExaminerViewer::getClassTypeId()) {
      // safe downward cast, knows the type
      So@Gui@ExaminerViewer * exviewer = (So@Gui@ExaminerViewer *)comp;
      /// [then something] ///
    }
    else if (comp->getTypeId().isOfType(So@Gui@FlyViewer::getClassTypeId())) {
      // safe downward cast, knows the type
      So@Gui@FlyViewer * flyviewer = (So@Gui@FlyViewer *)comp;
      // then something else
    }
  }
  \endcode
