  \class So@Gui@Mouse So@Gui@Mouse.h Inventor/@Gui@/devices/So@Gui@Mouse.h
  \brief The So@Gui@Mouse class is the mouse input device abstraction.
  \ingroup devices

  The So@Gui@Mouse class is the glue between native mouse handling and
  mouse interaction in the Inventor scenegraph.

  All components derived from the So@Gui@RenderArea have got an
  So@Gui@Mouse device attached by default.

  One important note for application programmers: our mappings to
  SoMouseButtonEvent::BUTTON2 and SoMouseButtonEvent::BUTTON3 do not
  match the mappings in SGI's InventorXt library or TGS's SoWin
  library for 3-button mice. They map mouse buttons like this:

  <ul>
  <li>left button: SoMouseButtonEvent::BUTTON1</li>
  <li>middle button: SoMouseButtonEvent::BUTTON2</li>
  <li>right button: SoMouseButtonEvent::BUTTON3</li>
  </ul>

  While in this SIM So@Gui@ library the mappings are:

  <ul>
  <li>left button: SoMouseButtonEvent::BUTTON1</li>
  <li>middle button: SoMouseButtonEvent::BUTTON3</li>
  <li>right button: SoMouseButtonEvent::BUTTON2</li>
  </ul>

  This is a conscious design decision we've made.  The reason is that
  BUTTON2 should be the right mouse button whether you have a 2-button
  mouse or a 3-button mouse.

/*!
  \fn const SoEvent * So@Gui@Mouse::translateEvent(@EVENT@ event)

  Translates a native event from the underlying toolkit into a generic
  event.

  This is then returned in the form of an instance of a subclass of
  the Inventor API's SoEvent class, either an SoMouseButtonEvent or an
  SoLocation2Event, depending on whether the native event is a
  mousebutton press / release, or a mousecursor movement event.

  The mapping of the mousebuttons upon generation of
  SoMouseButtonEvent events will be done as follows:

  <ul>
  <li>left mousebutton: SoMouseButtonEvent::BUTTON1</li>
  <li>right mousebutton: SoMouseButtonEvent::BUTTON2</li>
  <li>middle mousebutton, if available: SoMouseButtonEvent::BUTTON3</li>
  <li>forward motion on a wheel mouse: SoMouseButtonEvent::BUTTON4</li>
  <li>backward motion on a wheel mouse: SoMouseButtonEvent::BUTTON5</li>
  </ul>

  Note that the rightmost mousebutton will always map to
  SoMouseButtonEvent::BUTTON2, even on a 3-button mouse.
