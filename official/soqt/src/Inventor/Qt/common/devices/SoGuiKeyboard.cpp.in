  \class So@Gui@Keyboard So@Gui@Keyboard.h Inventor/@Gui@/devices/So@Gui@Keyboard.h
  \brief The So@Gui@Keyboard class is the keyboard input device abstraction.
  \ingroup devices

  The So@Gui@Keyboard class is the glue between native keyboard
  handling and keyboard interaction with the Inventor scenegraph.

  All components derived from the So@Gui@RenderArea have got an
  So@Gui@Keyboard device attached by default.
